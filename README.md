# gemini-fullstack-adk-quickstart

Get started with building Fullstack Agents using google-adk

## background and motivation

this project was inspired by [gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart)

I thought "Why would I prefer LangGraph over Google's own google-adk?"

I wasn't sure, so I built this POC to compare the implementations.

Other interesting Google Quickstarts:

- <https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-quickstart>
- <https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-image-editing-nextjs-quickstart>

It's also interesting to compare a more fully-featured agentic app:
[gng-ai](https://github.com/Vandivier/gng-ai): google-centric dnd with agents
